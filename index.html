    <h1>Gift Idea</h1>
    <p>Whether you celebrate the Jewish Festival of Lights every winter or will observe for the very first time this year, <br>
        the right gear makes the holiday even more joyous. Weâ€™ve done the work of rounding up everything you need for cooking, <br>
        menorah lighting, and decorating, along with some Hanukkah gift ideas, so that you can focus on what really matters: celebrating with loved ones.</p>
